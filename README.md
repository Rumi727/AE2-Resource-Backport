# Perfect AE2 Resource Backport  

Yes, as the name suggests, this backports 1.21.1 AE2 mod resources to version 1.20.1.  

Original AE2 Mod : https://modrinth.com/mod/ae2   

## What makes it different from other resource packs?  

**It doesn’t break.** Yep, that’s it.  
If there is any broken part, please let me know.  

Oh, right. There’s also a version that backports AE2WTLib and ExtendedAE.

## Note

In version 1.21.1, AE2's UI has changed significantly, so I couldn't perfectly recreate it. Some parts had to be manually drawn pixel by pixel, but since I'm not very good at pixel art, it might look a bit unnatural.  
I apologize for that.
