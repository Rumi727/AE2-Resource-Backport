Instructions for those who want to download individual resource packs

The AE2 Backport and AE2WTLib Backport folders in the root folder are backport resource packs for their respective mods.\
You can download them as is and apply the backports of your desired mod to Minecraft.

# Perfect AE2 Resource Backport  

Yes, as the name suggests, this backports 1.21.1 AE2 mod resources to version 1.20.1.  

Original AE2 Mod : https://modrinth.com/mod/ae2   

## What makes it different from other resource packs?  

**It doesn’t break.** Yep, that’s it.  
If there is any broken part, please let me know.  

Oh, right. There’s also a version that backports AE2WTLib and ExtendedAE and AppliedE and AdvancedAE.  
Check out the version

Original ExtenedAE Mod : https://modrinth.com/mod/extended-ae  
Original AppliedE Mod : https://modrinth.com/mod/appliede  
Original AdvancedAE Mod : https://modrinth.com/mod/advancedae

## Note

In version 1.21.1, AE2's UI has changed significantly, so I couldn't perfectly recreate it. Some parts had to be manually drawn pixel by pixel, but since I'm not very good at pixel art, it might look a bit unnatural.  
I apologize for that.
